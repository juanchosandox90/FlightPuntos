# FlightPuntos
App for testing flight search with Puntos Colombia.

# Implementation

The app archictecture is MVC. Im using SQLiteDatabase to Register, Login, and Mock the Flights Information. Any user can register and login with the registered account. Is validating correct email, correct name lenght, and some other validations.
Models will be created but no implemented. Instead, the mock will live in the Databasehelper for testing purposes. Also i implemented a profile visualization.

# Techonologies

Still in developing mode, migration to Firebase for Login and Register. Checkin times. DeadLine: April 7th 2019.
