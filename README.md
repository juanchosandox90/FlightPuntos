App for testing flight search with Puntos Colombia.

# Implementation

The app archictecture is MVC. Im using SQLiteDatabase to Register, Login, and Mock the Flights Information. Any user can register and login with the registered account. Is validating correct email, correct name lenght, and some other validations.
Models will be created but no implemented. Instead, the mock will live in the Databasehelper for testing purposes.
